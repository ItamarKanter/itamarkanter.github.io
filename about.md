I am a data scientist with many years of experience in deep and machine learning. I am currently working with cutting edge deep learning models for vision. I also have experience in high-throughput biology, including the analysis of high-throughput RNA-seq and single cells biological data.
Driven by a natural curiosity, I like to face new challenges and acquire novel skills and knowledge. I would like to address data driven challenges that will help me to exploit and further develop my skills. My moto is: “never say no to a new machine learning model that you don’t know”
