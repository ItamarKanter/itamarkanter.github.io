I am a data scientist with a wide experience in deep and machine learning. I'm currently working with cutting edge deep learning models for vision. I also have an experience in high-throughput biology, including the analysis of high-throughput RNA-seq and single cells biological data.  
Driven by a natural curiosity, I like to face new challenges and acquire novel skills and knowledge. 
I would like to address data driven challenges that will help me to exploit and further develop my skills. 
My Moto is: "never say no to a novel machine learning model that you don't know"
